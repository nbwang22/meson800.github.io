#I'm a PhD student at MIT working in the Galloway Lab. Out of all of the systems that chemical engineers
#examine, I've found that biological systems are the most fascinating, complex, and challenging systems
#we could possibly dream of working with.

#I've also always enjoyed coding. My favorite language was and still is C++; I've written several toy
#projects and contributed to several open-source development efforts with C++. I also enjoy Python, and use it
#pretty frequently as my go-to "glue", data-analysis, or prototyping language.

#When I'm not doing research or programming, I like to dabble: 3D modeling and animation, video editing, sailing, quadcopter construction, rocket building have all been #recent interests of mine.
