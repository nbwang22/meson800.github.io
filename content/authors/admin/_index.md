I am currently a PhD student in the Galloway Lab researching how to engineer gene regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming and how systems-level drivers can help increase reprogramming efficiency. Synthetic biology offers unique tools that can overcome barriers to reprogramming and can provide dynamic and state-responsive gene expression control. I am currently working on employing these tools to both understand what mechanisms mammalian cells use to reinforce or transition between different cell fate identities.
