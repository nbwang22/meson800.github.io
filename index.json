Synthetic biology offers unique tools that can overcome barriers to reprogramming and provide dynamic and state-responsive gene expression control. I am currently working on employing these tools to both understand what mechanisms mammalian cells use to reinforce or transition between different cell fate identities.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1605236190,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/nathan-wang/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/nathan-wang/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a PhD student in the Galloway Lab researching how to engineer gene regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming and how systems-level drivers can help increase reprogramming efficiency.","tags":null,"title":"Nathan Wang","type":"authors"}]
